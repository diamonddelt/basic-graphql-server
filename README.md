# basic-graphql-server
A basic graphQL server in javascript

GraphQL is quickly becoming an open-source standard for API data exchanges, to deprecate traditional REST APIs.

## Running the code

1. clone the repository and `cd` into the repository
2. `npm install` to pull down the modules
3. `node server.js` to run the GraphQL server locally on port 9000
4. In a browser, to go localhost:9000/graphiql to see the interactive GraphIQL explorer
